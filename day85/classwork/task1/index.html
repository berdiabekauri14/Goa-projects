    <!-- Project: User Registration System
Objective:
Build a simple user registration system where users can input their first name, last name, and age through a form. The data will be processed using a JavaScript class that incorporates class features such as methods, getter/setter, public fields, private fields, private methods, and static methods. The project will also display the number of users registered.

Project Requirements:
Form: Create an HTML form where users can input:

First name
Last name
Age
Class Structure:

Public Fields: Store user details like first name, last name, and age.
Private Fields: Keep sensitive or internal data hidden (e.g., ID or user validation status).
Methods: Add methods for validation, registration, and displaying user info.
Getter/Setter: Use getter/setter to access and update user details safely.
Private Methods: Add a private method to handle any internal logic (e.g., checking if the age is valid).
Static Methods: Keep track of how many users have been registered in the system (e.g., total user count).
DOM Manipulation:

When the user submits the form, create a new user instance using the class.
Validate the user input before allowing the user to be registered.
Display the user count and user details on the page once a valid user is registered.
Error Handling:

Display appropriate error messages if the input is invalid (e.g., age below 0 or empty fields). -->
